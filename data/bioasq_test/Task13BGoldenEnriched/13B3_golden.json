        "Two studies within the Pharma Proteomics Project identified primary genetic associations through pQTL mapping. One study, which analyzed nearly 3,000 proteins, reported 14,287 primary associations. A second study, involving a genome-wide association analysis of plasma protein levels using close to 5,000 aptamers in a cohort of 35,559 participants, identified 18,084 primary genetic associations.",
        "The mapping of 2,923 proteins within the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project identified 14,287 primary genetic associations. This finding is notable as 81% of these associations were previously undescribed. The project utilized protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) derived from two key sources: the deCODE Health study and the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project itself, which analyzed 4907 and 2923 plasma proteins, respectively. By integrating proteomic data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the research aimed to evaluate genetic associations, including those related to plasma proteins and specific conditions like POAG, using a powerful tool known as a proteome-wide association study (PWAS). The analysis employed a Bayesian model for pQTL to GWAS colocalization, ensuring a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05, thereby validating the significance of the identified genetic associations.",

Of these, 81% were previously undescribed, providing new insights into the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome. The study quantified over 2,900 proteins in blood plasma from 54,000 UK Biobank participants, identifying tens of thousands of pQTLs. From the 2,940 proteins tested, 504 unique plasma proteins had their expression affected by at least one HLA variant. Notable associations were found in specific genetic regions, including the ERAP1 and LECT2 regions in brain and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Specific protein associations included a local pQTL on chromosome 5 for PI4K2B and a distant pQTL on chromosome 12 for TRP53RKB. Moreover, primary genetic associations overlapped with clinically relevant GWAS hits for conditions such as atrial fibrillation, body mass index, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and coronary artery disease.",

The most common reasons for revision or replacement are heterotopic ossification and infection. However, revision and replacement surgeries have high success rates, ranging from 86.7% to 94.6%.\n\nTMJR using stock and custom-made prostheses has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving mandibular movements. The use of autogenous grafts, such as the temporalis superficial facia flap, has also been reported to have successful clinical results.\n\nWhile concerns regarding implant-related metal hypersensitivity exist, no guidelines have been accepted for screening or treatment of patients with metal sensitivity before TMJR. However, studies suggest that most surgeons believe metal hypersensitivity occurs with TMJR and take it into consideration during patient treatment.\n\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that TMJ replacement can be a successful treatment option for patients with end-stage TMJ disease.",

Specifically, aberrant connectivity between amygdala-frontal and frontal-striatal regions, as well as within and between the default mode and salience networks, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. These findings suggest that dysfunctional neural networks play a significant role in anxiety disorders.",
        "Yes, research has identified several brain abnormalities associated with anxiety disorders:\n\n1. **Amygdala Connectivity**: Increased connectivity between the amygdala and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex suggests heightened fear responses.\n\n2. **Network Controllability**: Reduced controllability in networks such as somatomotor, subcortical, and default mode indicates impaired brain function, particularly in regions like the superior frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate.\n\n3. **Prefrontal Cortex Activity**: Decreased alpha oscillations in the ventral prefrontal cortex point to potential issues with emotion regulation.\n\n4. **Striatal Coordination**: Adolescents with Social Anxiety Disorder exhibit abnormal coordination between the striatum and cortical regions, affecting reward processing and decision-making.\n\n5. **Amygdala Functioning**: Reduced activation during fear extinction and renewal in individuals with SAD highlights improper regulation of fear responses.\n\nThese findings collectively suggest that anxiety disorders are associated with specific brain abnormalities impacting emotional regulation and fear processing."

        "The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in the developmental process. Recent evidence supports that EMT allows the tumor cells to acquire invasive properties and to develop metastatic growth characteristics. Some of the transcription factors that are actively involved in the EMT process have a significant role in the EMT-metastasis linkage. A number of studies have reported that EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), such as Twist, Snail, Slug, and Zeb, are directly or indirectly involved in cancer cell metastasis through various signaling cascades.",
        "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical biological process where epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, gaining enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities. This process is driven by a set of core transcription factors that regulate the transcriptional reprogramming necessary for EMT. Key transcription factors involved in this process include Snail (SNAI1), Slug (SNAI2), Twist, and ZEB1/2. These factors function by repressing epithelial markers and inducing mesenchymal markers, thereby facilitating the transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype. Snail and Slug are particularly noted for their roles in downregulating E-cadherin, a critical molecule for maintaining epithelial cell-cell adhesion, thus promoting the dissociation of epithelial cells and enhancing motility (PMID 24556840). Additionally, the dynamic nature of EMT, stimulated by various signaling pathways, underscores the complexity and the regulatory mechanisms orchestrated by these transcription factors in response to physiological and pathological stimuli (PMID 34708244). This regulatory landscape highlights the importance of transcriptional control in the modulation of cellular identity and behavior during EMT."

Additionally, shared rare variant risks between epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders were implicated, underscoring the value of large-scale sequencing and deep-phenotyping efforts in unraveling the complex genetic architecture of epilepsy.",

Studies have identified genetic risk factors for highly heterogeneous disorders like epilepsy, which remains challenging. By using a hypothesis-free approach, potential novel associations were identified, with most discoveries specific to a particular subtype of epilepsy, highlighting distinct genetic contributions to different epilepsies. Combining evidence from rare single nucleotide/short indel-, copy number-, and common variants, convergence of different genetic risk factors at individual gene level was found.

These molecules mediate target cell killing through pore formation (perforin) and apoptosis induction (granzymes). Evidence from multiple studies confirms their co-expression in CD8+ T cells and NK cells, with specific references to elevated granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-γ in cytotoxic subsets of both cell types. This shared mechanism underlies their roles in immune defense against infected or malignant cells.",

In NK cells these proteins are constitutively expressed, while in CD8⁺ T cells their expression is up‑regulated upon activation and differentiation into effector cells.",

They release cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzyme B to induce cell death. Additionally, NK cells may employ other mechanisms such as cytokine production.\n\nIn summary, while both CD8+ T cells and NK cells utilize perforin and granzyme B for cytotoxicity, their target recognition differs—CD8+ T cells are antigen-specific, whereas NK cells have a broader, less specific approach.",

Here we identify associations between rare protein-coding variants and 2,923 plasma protein abundances measured in 49,736 UK Biobank individuals. Our variant-level exome-wide association study identified 5,433 rare genotype-protein associations, of which 81% were undetected in a previous genome-wide association study of the same cohort5. We then looked at aggregate signals using gene-level collapsing analysis, which revealed 1,962 gene-protein associations. Of the 691 gene-level signals from protein-truncating variants, 99.4% were associated with decreased protein levels. STAB1 and STAB2, encoding scavenger receptors involved in plasma protein clearance, emerged as pleiotropic loci, with 77 and 41 protein associations, respectively. We demonstrate the utility of our publicly accessible resource through several applications. These include detailing an allelic series in NLRC4, identifying potential biomarkers for a fatty liver disease-associated variant in HSD17B13 and bolstering phenome-wide association studies by integrating protein quantitative trait loci with protein-truncating variants in collapsing analyses. Finally, we uncover distinct proteomic consequences of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), including an association between TET2-CH and increased FLT3 levels. Our results highlight a considerable role for rare variation in plasma protein abundance and the value of proteogenomics in therapeutic discovery.",

        "Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive type of brain tumor for which there is no curative treatment available. Immunotherapies have shown limited responses in unselected patients, and there is an urgent need to identify mechanisms of treatment resistance to design novel therapy strategies. The mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma has been described to evade tumor immunotherapy, driven by increased PD-L1 expression, number of TAMs, and proliferative and exhausted T cells.",
        "Yes, mesenchymal-like glioblastoma (GBM) cells exhibit increased immune evasion. The mesenchymal subtype of GBM is characterized by elevated expression of immunosuppressive markers (e.g., YKL-40, PD-L1) and resistance to immune therapies. Tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived transcriptional programs in this subtype promote immune evasion, contributing to poor prognosis. Additionally, mesenchymal GBM\u0027s immunosuppressive microenvironment and epigenetic immunoediting further enhance its ability to evade anti-tumor immune responses.",
        "Mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells consistently exhibit increased immune evasion, as agreed upon by all sources. This evasion is multifaceted, involving alterations in the tumor microenvironment, elevated PD-L1 expression (notably in vascular endothelial cells), vascular immune escape, interactions with pro-tumor macrophages, and modulation of cell adhesion molecules like VE-Cadherin. These mechanisms collectively lead to reduced T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity, as evidenced by increased mesenchymal marker expression. Consequently, this enhanced immune evasion is associated with poorer disease survival and diminished effectiveness of immunotherapy, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to overcome these immune evasive tactics.",
        "Yes. Mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells exhibit enhanced immune evasion through multiple mechanisms. They upregulate immune checkpoint ligands such as PD‑L1, secrete immunosuppressive cytokines including TGF‑β and IL‑10, and release exosomes carrying suppressive microRNAs. They attract and polarize tumor‑associated macrophages and myeloid‑derived suppressor cells, foster regulatory T cell infiltration, and downregulate antigen‑presentation pathways. Together these alterations create a profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment that protects mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells from cytotoxic T cell and natural killer cell attacks.",
        "Yes, mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells exhibit increased immune evasion, characterized by elevated PD-L1 expression, reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and T cell exhaustion. This evasion is mediated by interactions with vascular endothelial cells, involving VE-Cadherin, leading to increased angiogenesis. Mesenchymal markers (YKL-40, Vimentin) are associated with these immune evasive mechanisms, resulting in poor disease survival and a limited response to immunotherapies, such as nivolumab, due to a shift towards a more aggressive mesenchymal-like tumor state.",
        "Yes, mesenchymal-like glioblastoma (GBM) cells exhibit increased immune evasion. This conclusion is supported by several key observations:\n\n1. **Resistance to Immunotherapy**: Mesenchymal GBM (mGBM) is noted for its resistance to anti-tumor immune therapies, indicating a potential mechanism of immune evasion.\n\n2. **Correlation with PD-L1 Expression**: Clinical data shows that mesenchymal markers such as YKL-40 and Vimentin are associated with elevated PD-L1 levels. PD-L1 is known to facilitate immune evasion by suppressing T cell activity.\n\n3. **Tumor Microenvironment Changes**: Mesenchymal-like GBM cells are linked to an increase in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and exhausted T cells. TAMs can promote tumor growth and suppress immune responses, while exhausted T cells are less effective in attacking cancer cells.\n\n4. **Poor Treatment Outcomes**: The presence of these features correlates with poor disease survival, suggesting that mesenchymal-like GBM cells have enhanced mechanisms to evade the immune system, leading to resistance against current therapies.\n\nIn summary, the combination of high PD-L1 expression, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and resistance to immunotherapy strongly supports the conclusion that mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells demonstrate increased immune evasion.",
        "Mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells exhibit increased immune evasion, characterized by elevated PD-L1 expression, higher tumor-associated macrophages, T cell exhaustion, and specific mesenchymal marker expression, leading to poor disease survival and highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies.",
        "Mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells exhibit increased immune evasion, primarily through elevated PD-L1 expression and a shift in the tumor microenvironment in response to immunotherapy. This leads to inhibited T cell cytotoxicity, increased tumor-associated macrophages, and an overall reduced immune response. Clinically, this phenomenon is associated with therapy resistance and poor survival outcomes, highlighting the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to overcome these evasion mechanisms and improve patient prognosis.",
        "Yes. Glioblastoma cells that acquire a mesenchymal‐like state upregulate PD‐L1, recruit immunosuppressive tumor‐associated macrophages and drive T cell exhaustion, leading to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapies, and are associated with poorer patient survival.",
        "Mesenchymal glioblastoma (mGBM) cells exhibit increased immune evasion, as evidenced by the upregulation of PD-L1, a protein that suppresses the immune system, and a resistance mechanism signature associated with increased exhausted T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in response to immunotherapy. This mesenchymal transition is correlated with poor disease survival and explains the limited responses seen in unselected glioblastoma patients undergoing immunotherapy."

We demonstrate the successful application of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) monitoring with multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in assisting intra-arterial infusions of fasudil hydrochloride to a patient suffering from post-SAH vasospasm in the distal vascular territories.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man presented with SAH and intracerebral hematoma due to ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm developed aphasia and right-sided weakness on day 9 after SAH onset. Delayed cerebral ischemia attributable to diffuse vasospasm in the distal territories of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries was suspected. Since the symptoms persisted despite maximal hyperdynamic therapy with dobutamine, intra-arterial fasudil treatment in the setting of rSO(2) monitoring including the spasm-affected vascular territory with four-channel flexible NIRS sensors was subsequently performed. Decreased and fluctuating rSO(2) in angiographically documented vasospastic territories increased immediately after intra-arterial fasudil infusion in accordance with relief of vasospasm that correlated with neurological improvement. The procedure was repeated on day 11 since the effect was transient and neurological deterioration and reduction of rSO(2) recurred. The deficits resolved accompanied by uptake and maintenance of rSO (2) following the intra-arterial fasudil, resulting in favorable functional outcome.CONCLUSION: Continuous rSO(2) monitoring with multichannel NIRS is a feasible strategy to assist intraarterial fasudil therapy for detecting and treating the focal isc",

        "Fasudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor used in some countries, such as Japan, for managing cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral vasospasm is a dangerous complication that can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia and worsen patient outcomes after a hemorrhage. By inhibiting Rho kinase, fasudil acts to relax vascular smooth muscle, thereby reducing the risk or severity of vasospasm. Clinical studies in regions where it is approved suggest that fasudil can lead to better vasospasm profiles and improved neurological outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, its regulatory status and routine clinical use vary by country. For instance, in the United States, fasudil is not approved by the FDA for this indication and is used only off-label or as part of investigational protocols. Therefore, while fasudil has potential benefits in the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage by reducing vasospasm, its use must align with local regulatory approvals and clinical guidelines.",
        "Yes, Fasudil can be used for subarachnoid haemorrhage. Fasudil is a small molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and is approved for the treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage, showing a favourable safety profile since its approval in Japan in 1995.",
        "Fasudil is a Rho‐kinase inhibitor approved in Japan for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is administered intravenously during and after aneurysm surgery or selectively via intra‐arterial infusion when vasospasm arises. Clinical studies have shown that fasudil reduces the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, shortens cerebral circulation time, and yields clinical outcomes comparable to or better than nimodipine, with a favorable safety profile. Early or prophylactic use in the perioperative period and targeted intra‐arterial therapy for refractory vasospasm make fasudil a valuable option in managing subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
        "Based on the provided contexts, Fasudil can be used for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Several studies mentioned in the contexts have used Fasudil to prevent or treat cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor, has shown outstanding therapeutic effects against cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in humans.

The algorithm calculates the convergence of these distributions across studies, generating statistical maps (ALE scores) that highlight regions with significant spatial overlap. Significance is determined by comparing results against a null distribution of random spatial convergence, typically using permutation testing and family-wise error correction. ALE is implemented via tools like GingerALE, enabling integration of data from diverse experiments to map robust neural correlates of cognitive processes, disorders, or interventions.

        "Current studies point at various mutations related to pancreatic cancer, such as BRCA1 and 2, KRAS mutation alleles, and KRAS oncogenic mutations.",
        "Studies have identified several genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Key mutations include BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are particularly notable in high-risk individuals undergoing surveillance. The PALB2 mutation is also significant, especially for women with a family history of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, mutations in MMR genes, associated with hereditary syndromes like HNPCC, contribute to an increased risk. Other implicated genes include FANCC and FANCG, which may lead to sporadic cases, as well as tumor suppressor genes such as MAP2K4 and MADH4 (SMAD4). These germline mutations often manifest in families with multiple affected members, highlighting the importance of genetic predisposition in pancreatic cancer risk.",
        "Mutations that are known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA2 mutations are associated with a high risk, and BRCA1 mutations also have a moderate to high risk association. Familial studies have identified BRCA2 mutations in around 6% of high-risk families. Mutations in the ATM, CDKN2A, and TP53 genes are also linked to a higher risk of pancreatic cancer. Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes and Lynch syndrome mutations, particularly MSH2 and MSH6, show an increased risk as well. PALB2 mutations are associated with a high risk. Additional genes such as MLH1, p16, DPC4 (SMAD4), and K-ras also elevate the risk. K-ras mutations, especially in codon 12, are common in many pancreatic cancers. Other notable mutations include those in STK11/LKB1, found in familial registries, and CTRC polymorphism p.G60\u003d and SPINK1 p.N34S mutation, which are observed at higher frequencies in patient tests. Genetic testing for these mutations is recommended to guide treatment and manage risks in individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer. Understanding these genetic factors can aid in early detection and personalized treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer.",
        "Several mutations have been identified as increasing the risk for pancreatic cancer. These include:\n\n* Germline mutations in ATM (encoding the DNA-damage signaling kinase, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated)\n* Germline mutations in BRCA2\n* Germline mutations in p16 (FAMMM syndrome)\n* Genetic mutations in STK11/LKB1 (Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome)\n* SPINK-1 mutation\n* CTRC (p.R254W) mutation\n* RNF43 (RING finger 43) mutations, found in 6-10% of pancreatic tumors\n* TP53 mutations, found in more than 75% of human pancreatic tumors\n* CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families\n\nThese mutations can increase the risk for developing pancreatic cancer, and some may also be associated with other types of cancer.",
        "Based on the provided abstracts, several mutations have been associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer:\n\n1. CDKN2A (p16) germline mutations: Increase the risk of melanoma and pancreatic cancer (FAMMM syndrome).\n2. BRCA2 germline mutations: Predispose to both breast and pancreatic cancer.\n3. ATM germline mutations: Increase Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FPC) susceptibility.\n4. STK11/LKB1 germline mutations: Associated with pancreatic cancer in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS).\n5. SPINK-1 mutation: Increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by 12-fold compared to the control group.\n6. Specific pN34s mutation: Related to pancreatic cancer.\n7. CTRC polymorphism Hetero p.G60\u003d(c.180C\u003eT): Found in 41.7% of patients with pancreatic cancer, compared to 18.6% in the control group.\n8. SSTR5 genetic variants (P109S and L48M AC): Play a role in pancreatic cancer development and progression.\n\nThese mutations may contribute to an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, but it is essential to consult the original studies and expert opinions for more detailed information.",
        "Mutations that increase the risk for pancreatic cancer include:\n\n1. **BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations**: Women with BRCA1 mutations have approximately a 2% lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer, while those with BRCA2 mutations face a slightly higher risk at around 3%. These mutations are associated with an increased susceptibility to various cancers, including pancreatic.\n\n2. **CDKN2A Mutations**: This tumor suppressor gene plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle. Mutations in CDKN2A have been linked to an elevated risk of developing pancreatic cancer, among other malignancies.\n\n3. **KRAS Oncogenic Mutations**: KRAS is a well-known oncogene involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival. Mutations in KRAS are common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and significantly contribute to the disease\u0027s progression and development.\n\n4. **ERBB2 (HER2) Mutations**: While primarily associated with breast cancer, ERBB2 mutations can also play a role in other cancers, including pancreatic. Overexpression or mutations in HER2 may contribute to increased risk or aggressive disease characteristics.\n\n5. **Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) Transcription Factors**: These factors are involved in lipid metabolism and cell growth. Their involvement suggests they might contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer, though their specific role is less well-defined compared to other mutations listed.\n\nIn summary, BRCA1/BRCA2, CDKN2A, KRAS, ERBB2, and SREBP mutations are associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Each mutation contributes differently to the disease process, highlighting the complexity of genetic factors in pancreatic malignancies."

Recent studies have only begun to elucidate the different cell states present in GBM and how they correlate with sensitivity to therapy. Furthermore, it has become clear that GBM heterogeneity not only depends on intrinsic factors but also strongly differs between new and recurrent GBM, and treatment naïve and experienced patients.

        "Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and lethal primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. The primary causes of GBM mortality are treatment resistance and tumor relapse where heterogeneity plays a significant role in their development. In particular, neighboring glioma cells maintain extreme degrees of genetic and phenotypic variation that form intratumoral heterogeneity. This genetic diversity allows the most adaptive tumor clones to develop treatment resistance, ultimately leading to disease recurrence. Heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences leading to a dynamic environment that consists of diverse tumor elements and treatment responses. Thus, understanding and designing targeted therapies based on a range of molecular profiles can be a more effective strategy to eradicate treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis.",
        "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor characterized by rapid growth and invasion into surrounding brain tissue. The heterogeneity of GBM, which includes genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic variability within and between tumors, poses significant challenges for treatment. This heterogeneity results in diverse responses to therapies, as different subpopulations of tumor cells may respond differently to the same treatment. Consequently, some cells may be inherently resistant or acquire resistance to therapy, leading to treatment failure and tumor recurrence. The development of personalized therapy approaches that account for the specific characteristics of a patient\u0027s tumor is critical for improving treatment outcomes. This includes the identification of biomarkers that can predict treatment response and the use of targeted therapies designed to overcome resistance mechanisms. Additionally, novel drug delivery systems, such as nanoemulgel formulations for nose-to-brain delivery, are being explored to bypass the blood-brain barrier and target GBM more effectively. Overall, understanding and addressing GBM heterogeneity is essential for the development of more effective treatment strategies and improving patient prognosis.",
        "GBM heterogeneity substantially affects treatment response by introducing variability in tumor molecular, genetic, and cellular compositions, leading to diverse drug sensitivities, therapeutic resistances, and poor outcomes.

Additionally, emerging therapies may offer future solutions to overcome these challenges, though further research is needed to fully leverage these advancements.",
        "Glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity significantly impacts treatment response by creating variability in tumor biology and therapeutic outcomes. Studies demonstrate that genetic, molecular, and environmental differences among GBM cells influence how they respond to therapies. For instance, the expression of specific markers like EGFRvIII or mutations in pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR can lead to divergent responses to treatments like radiation or targeted inhibitors. Additionally, tumor microenvironment factors, including hypoxia and immune suppression, contribute to treatment resistance by altering cellular behavior and reducing the efficacy of immunotherapies. The heterogeneity also manifests in varying drug sensitivities observed in patient-derived xenograft models, where molecular profiles and blood-brain barrier effects play a crucial role. Furthermore, culture conditions and cell line differences can affect susceptibility to therapies like NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Overall, GBM\u0027s inherent diversity at both the cellular and molecular levels poses a significant challenge for developing universally effective treatments, as it results in highly variable responses across different tumors and patients.",
        "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by significant heterogeneity, which impacts treatment response at genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic levels.

Epigenetic differences influence gene expression and affect responses to chemotherapy and radiation. The tumor microenvironment, including interactions with stromal cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix, varies within the tumor and can protect cells from therapeutic agents, promoting resistance. GBM cells also exhibit phenotypic plasticity, allowing them to transition between different states and evade treatments targeting specific processes. Additionally, a subpopulation of cancer stem cells within GBM is particularly resistant to conventional therapies and can lead to tumor recurrence. This heterogeneity complicates treatment strategies and contributes to the poor prognosis of GBM, often necessitating combination therapies that target multiple pathways and cell populations within the tumor.",

Intratumoral heterogeneity is considered a hallmark of GBM, negatively influencing therapeutic outcomes. The molecular heterogeneity of gene expression profiles contributes to tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Tumor-intrinsic factors, including heterogeneity, hypermutation, altered metabolomics, and alternative splicing pathways, change the tumor landscape, facilitating therapy failure and tumor progression. This heterogeneity also enables tumor cells to escape the effects of therapy, contributing to the limited survival duration for GBM patients despite advances in neurosurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.",

Molecular subtypes can shift under treatment pressure, activating alternative signaling routes that targeted drugs cannot block. As a result, therapy provokes only partial tumor shrinkage, leaves resistant cell populations behind and leads to rapid recurrence, limiting overall patient survival.",
        "Glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity significantly impacts treatment response by presenting a complex challenge due to its multifaceted nature: 1. Intrinsic Heterogeneity : GBMs exhibit genetic diversity within and across tumors. This means different cells or regions may have varying mutations, making it difficult for targeted therapies to affect all parts of the tumor. Cells resistant to certain treatments can persist, leading to recurrence. 2. Environmental Influences : The tumor\u0027s microenvironment varies, influencing cell behavior. Different areas might respond differently to treatments based on environmental factors, complicating therapeutic outcomes. 3. Treatment Resistance and Recurrence : Heterogeneity increases the likelihood of pre existing resistant subclones within the tumor. Treatments may eliminate some cells but leave others untouched, allowing these resilient cells to proliferate post treatment, causing recurrence. 4. Inconsistent Responses : The non uniform nature of GBMs means treatments can have inconsistent effects across different regions of the tumor, leading to incomplete responses and treatment failure. In essence, GBM\u0027s heterogeneity creates a dynamic and resistant target for therapies, necessitating comprehensive approaches that address both genetic diversity and environmental influences to improve outcomes.",

        "Glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity significantly impacts treatment response by creating a diverse tumor environment characterized by genetic and phenotypic variations among neighboring glioma cells. This intratumoral heterogeneity allows the most adaptive tumor clones to develop treatment resistance, leading to treatment failure and disease recurrence. As a result, targeted therapies often prove ineffective due to the complex signaling cascades regulating this heterogeneity. The presence of polyclonal tumors further complicates treatment, necessitating the development of individualized treatment strategies that consider the range of molecular profiles to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. Overall, the dynamic nature of GBM heterogeneity is a major barrier to successful treatment outcomes.",
        "Glioblastoma multiforme exhibits extensive inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity arising from both intrinsic genetic evolution and microenvironmental influences. This polyclonal diversity generates subpopulations with distinct genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic traits, some of which preexist treatment and harbor intrinsic resistance to temozolomide or other agents. Niches of glioma stem cells and dynamic cell-state plasticity ensure that even a single surviving cell can seed regrowth. Targeted therapies often fail because resistant clones activate alternative signaling pathways when one route is blocked. Consequently, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy rarely eradicate all subpopulations, allowing therapy-resistant cells to repopulate the tumor and drive rapid disease recurrence.",
        "GBM heterogeneity, encompassing both inter- and intratumoral variations, significantly impacts treatment response by fostering resistance and unfavorable prognoses. This heterogeneity, stemming from genetic and phenotypic diversity among glioma cells, allows adaptive tumor clones to develop treatment resistance, leading to disease recurrence. It affects genetic expression, modulates metabolic pathways, and enables immune system evasion. The diverse tumor elements and treatment responses within polyclonal tumors create a dynamic environment that facilitates therapy failure and tumor progression. Consequently, the molecular heterogeneity observed in gene expression profiles of GBM is a critical prognostic factor for tumor recurrence and drug resistance. The immunosuppressive microenvironment and inherent tumor heterogeneity contribute to therapeutic resistance, making GBM a model of resistance to immunotherapy.",
        "Intratumor heterogeneity is the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence in glioblastoma (GBM). Intratumoral heterogeneity plays a significant role in treatment resistance and tumor relapse, which are the primary causes of mortality. Neighbouring glioma cells maintain extreme degrees of genetic and phenotypic variation that form intratumoural heterogeneity. This genetic diversity allows the most adaptive tumour clones to develop treatment resistance, ultimately leading to disease recurrence. Polyclonal tumours create a dynamic environment that consists of diverse tumour elements and treatment responses.",
        "Glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity significantly impacts treatment response by creating a diverse tumor environment characterized by genetic and phenotypic variation among neighboring glioma cells. This intratumoral heterogeneity allows the most adaptive tumor clones to develop treatment resistance, leading to treatment failure and disease recurrence. The complex nature of GBM cells, influenced by factors such as the local inflammatory tumor microenvironment, further complicates therapeutic efficacy. Consequently, targeted therapies that consider the range of molecular profiles within GBM may enhance treatment outcomes and address the challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding this diversity is crucial for developing individualized treatment strategies and improving the survival rates of GBM patients.",
        "Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer characterized by significant intratumoral heterogeneity, which refers to the presence of diverse cell populations within a single tumor. This diversity includes genetic variations and differences in cellular behavior. Such heterogeneity significantly impacts treatment response in several ways:\n\n1. **Treatment Resistance**: The presence of varied cell types within the tumor means that some cells may be inherently resistant to standard therapies like chemotherapy or radiation. These resistant cells can survive treatment and lead to recurrence.\n\n2. **Recurrence**: After treatment, the surviving resistant cells can regrow the tumor, contributing to disease relapse. This is a major challenge in effectively managing GBM.\n\n3. **Dynamic Tumor Environment**: The diversity within the tumor creates a complex environment where different cell populations may respond differently to treatments. This variability makes it difficult for any single therapy to target all cancerous cells effectively.\n\n4. **Need for Targeted Therapies**: Given the genetic diversity, there is a potential benefit in designing targeted therapies that address a range of molecular profiles within the tumor. This approach could help overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy.\n\nIn summary, GBM heterogeneity leads to challenges in treatment due to diverse cell populations that may resist therapy and cause recurrence. Addressing this diversity with targeted therapies offers a promising strategy for more effective treatment.",
        "Glioblastoma’s extreme genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic diversity creates multiple cell populations with distinct drug sensitivities and survival strategies. Treatments such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or targeted agents may eliminate some clones while resistant subpopulations—including therapy-evasive cancer stem-like cells—survive and drive rapid regrowth. Moreover, subtype switching and activation of alternative signaling pathways allow tumors to adapt to and escape targeted inhibitors. This intratumoral heterogeneity thus underlies frequent treatment failure, rapid recurrence and the uniformly poor prognosis seen in GBM patients.",
        "GBM heterogeneity can affect treatment response in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to treatment failure and recurrence due to the presence of different types of tumor cells within the same tumor. Secondly, it can make it difficult to identify the most effective treatment for the tumor, as different parts of the tumor may respond differently to the same treatment. Finally, it can make it difficult to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, as the tumor may change over time due to the heterogeneity."

Methods: Retrospective case series study. The clinical data of 123 patients with newly diagnosed MM from August 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and Suzhou Hopes Hematology Hospital, who were eligible for VRD regimen sequential ASCT, were collected. The clinical characteristics, efficacy after induction therapy, mobilization regimen of autologous stem cells, autologous stem cell collection rate, and side effects and efficacy of ASCT were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Of the 123 patients, 67 were males. The median patient age was 56 (range: 31-70) years. Patients with IgG, IgA, IgD, and light-chain types accounted for 47.2% (58/123), 23.6% (29/123), 3.2% (4/123), and 26.0% (32/123) of patients, respectively. In addition, 25.2% (31/123) of patients had renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance rate\u003c40 ml/min). Patients with Revised-International Staging System (R-ISS) Ⅲ accounted for 18.2% (22/121) of patients. After induction therapy, the rates of partial response and above, very-good partial response (VGPR) and above, and complete response (CR)+stringent CR were 82.1% (101/123), 75.6% (93/123), and 45.5% (56/123), respectively. Overall, 90.3% (84/93) of patients were mobilized with cyclophosphamide+granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 8 patients with G-CSF or G-CSF+plerixafor due to creatinine clearance rate\u003c30 ml/min and one of them was mobilized with DECP (cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone)+G-CSF for progressive disease. The rate of autologous stem cell collection (CD34+cells≥2×106/kg) after four courses of VRD regimen was 89.1% (82/92), and the rate of collection (CD34+cells≥5×106/kg) was 56.5% (52/92). Seventy-seven patients treated with the VRD regimen sequential ASCT. All patients had grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Among the nonhematologic adverse events during ASCT, the highest incidence was observed for gastrointestinal reactions (76.6%, 59/77), followed by oral mucositis (46.8%, 36/77), elevated aminotransferases (44.2%, 34/77), fever (37.7%, 29/77), infection (16.9%, 13/77) and heart-related adverse events (11.7%, 9/77). Among the adverse events, grade 3 adverse events included nausea (6.5%, 5/77), oral mucositis (5.2%, 4/77), vomiting (3.9%, 3/77), infection (2.6%, 2/77), elevated blood pressure after infusion (2.6%, 2/77), elevated alanine transaminase (1.3%, 1/77), and perianal mucositis (1.3%, 1/77); there were no grade 4 or above nonhematologic adverse events. The proportion of patients who achieved VGPR and above after VRD sequential ASCT was 100% (75/75), and the proportion of patients who were minimal residual disease-negative (\u003c10-4 level) was 82.7% (62/75). Conclusion: In patients aged 70 and below with newly diagnosed MM treated with VRD induction therapy, the collection rate of autologous stem cells was good, and good efficacy and tolerability were noted after follow-up ASCT.",

Methods: The clinical characteristics, survival rates, response rates and minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with NDMM at Institute of Hematology \u0026 Blood Diseases Hospital from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Subgroup analysis was also performed among groups according to the cytogenetics and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) of patients. Results: A total of 87 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The age[M(Q1,Q3)] of all patients was 56 (51, 61) years and males and females accounted for 58.6% (51/87) and 41.4% (36/87), respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was 95.9% (71/74) after 2 courses of induction therapy, with 13.5% (10/74) achieving the deep response [complete response (CR) or better] and 51.3% (38/74) of patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) or better. After 4 courses of induction therapy, the ORR achieved 95.2% (60/63), and the proportions of the deep response and VGPR or better grew up to 46.0% (29/63) and 77.7% (49/63). According to the treatment, the patients (≤65 years old) were divided into transplantation group and non-transplantation group. After the induction therapy, 88.8% (32/36) of patients in the transplantation group achieved VGPR or better, and 55.5% (20/36) reached the deep response. After the transplantation, the proportion increased to 97.1% (34/35) and 77.2% (27/35), respectively(88.8% vs 97.1%,P\u003d0.174;55.5% vs 77.2%,P\u003d0.055), with the rate of undetectable MRD increasing from 44.4% (16/36) to 77.8% (28/36) (P\u003d0.004). In the non-transplantation group, 74.2% (23/31) of patients achieved VGPR or better after 4 courses of induction therapy, 35.5% (11/31) of the patients achieved deep response and the rate of undetectable MRD was 37.0% (10/27). Compared with the non-transplantation group, transplantation was associated with a higher rate of complete response (89.5% vs 53.1%, P\u003c0.001) and a lower rate of MRD detection(78.4% vs 55.2%, P\u003d0.045). The median follow-up time of all patients was 26.3 months (20.8, 33.8). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached. The three-year PFS and OS rates were 78.4% and 87.2%, respectively. None of the standard-risk group, the high-risk group, the transplantation group and non-transplantation group achieved the median PFS and OS. Conclusions: VRD regimen has a promising efficacy and results in a substantial survival benefit. ASCT after VRD induction therapy is associated with higher rate of deep response, higher rate of undetectable MRD and longer survival.",

Methods: A total of 150 newly diagnosed patients with MM diagnosed in The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from November 2018 to February 2021 and received VRD as the induction regimen were included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VRD induction therapy for newly diagnosed MM. Results: The median follow-up was 22 months, two patients (1.3%) died early after treatment, and 148 patients (98.7%) completed induction therapy. 116 patients (77.3%) were mobilized to collect autologous hematopoietic stem cells, 101 cases (87.1%) were qualified in the collection, of which 48 cases (41.4%) were excellent in the collection. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 59%, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 83%. After induction, complete remission (CR) /stringent CR rate was 54.4%, ≥ very good partial remission rate was 77.3%, overall response rate was 86.0%, and minimal residual disease negative rate was 46.0%. There was no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of cytogenetic high-risk patients compared with standard risk patients (P\u003d0.456) . The median PFS time of cytogenetic high-risk patients was shorter than that of standard risk patients (not reached vs 33 months, P\u003d0.014) . There was no statistically significant difference in the median OS time (not reached vs not reached, P\u003d0.072) . The highest incidence of hematological adverse events was thrombocytopenia (72%) , followed by neutropenia (42%) and anemia (20%) . The highest incidence of non-hematological adverse events was peripheral neuritis (56.7%) . The main digestive tract symptoms include constipation (30.0%) and diarrhea (17.3%) . Upper respiratory tract infection (23.3%) and lung infection (7.3%) are the main infections. The incidence of adverse thrombocytopenia (90.0% vs 63.7%, P\u003d0.001) , neutropenia (54.2% vs 36.3%, P\u003d0.038) , anemia (33.3% vs 13.7%, P\u003d0.005) , diarrhea (27.1% vs 12.7%, P\u003d0.030) , limb edema (20.8% vs 3.9%, P\u003d0.030) , fever (20.8% vs 4.9%, P\u003d0.006) , thrombosis (8.3% vs 0, P\u003d0.016) , and renal function deterioration (20.8% vs 3.9%, P\u003d0.030) in patients with renal insufficiency was higher than that in patients with normal renal function. Conclusion: The VRD regimen has a significant effect on newly diagnosed MM, does not affect the hematopoietic stem cell collection, and has controllable adverse events; however, the incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with renal insufficiency.",

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, And Polyols), which can be found in many common foods. A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is increasingly suggested for IBS treatment. However, long-term, large, randomized controlled studies are still lacking, and certainties and doubts regarding LFDs have grown, often in a disorderly and confused manner. Some potential LFD limitations and concerns have been raised, including nutritional adequacy, cost, and difficulty in teaching the diet and maintaining it. Most of these limitations can be solved with the involvement of a skilled nutritionist, who can clearly explain the different phases of the LFD and ensure nutritional adequacy and compliance. Further studies should focus on new methods of teaching and learning the LFD and on predictors of response. Moreover, particular interest should be focused on the possible use of LFD in gastrointestinal diseases other than functional disorders and, possibly, also in non-gastrointestinal diseases. The aim of the present review was to clarify the effective and appropriate indications and limitations of an LFD and to discuss its possible future uses.",

Gut microbiota, which acts as a real organ with well-defined functions, is in a mutualistic relationship with the host, harvesting additional energy and nutrients from the diet and protecting the host from pathogens; specific alterations in its composition seem to play a crucial role in IBS pathophysiology. It is well known that diet can significantly modulate the intestinal microbiota profile but it is less known how different nutritional approach effective in IBS patients, such as the low-FODMAP diet, could be responsible of intestinal microbiota changes, thus influencing the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of this review was to explore the effects of different nutritional protocols (e.g., traditional nutritional advice, low-FODMAP diet, gluten-free diet, etc.) on IBS-D symptoms and on intestinal microbiota variations in both IBS-D patients and healthy subjects. To date, an ideal nutritional protocol does not exist for IBS-D patients but it seems crucial to consider the effect of the different nutritional approaches on the intestinal microbiota composition to better define an efficient strategy to manage this functional disorder.",

However, the complexities of diet have made identifying specific food intolerances difficult. Eating disorders can masquerade as IBS and may need specialist treatment. While typical food allergy is readily distinguished from IBS, the mechanisms of gut-specific adverse reactions to food are only just being defined. These may include gut-specific mast cell activation as well as non-specific activation by stressors and certain foods. Visceral hypersensitivity, in some cases mediated by mast cell activation, plays a key part in making otherwise innocuous gut stimuli painful. Rapidly fermented poorly absorbed carbohydrates produce gaseous distension as well as short-chain fatty acids and lowering of colonic pH which may cause symptoms in IBS patients. Limiting intake of these in low FODMAP and related diets has proven popular and apparently successful in many patients. Existing diet, colonic microbiota and their metabolic products may be helpful in predicting who will respond. Wheat intolerance may reflect the fact that wheat is often a major source of dietary FODMAPs. It may also be either a forme fruste of coeliac disease or non-specific immune activation. Wheat exclusion can be successful in some of these patients. More research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of food intolerances and how to best ameliorate them in a personalised medicine approach to diet in IBS.",

A recently devised dietary approach consists of restricting foods with highly fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), which can trigger and/or exacerbate IBS symptoms. The aim of this study is to use meta-analysis to provide an update on the randomised control trials (RCTs) and cohort studies, and examine them separately in relation to diet type. Papers were selected using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart. Cohen\u0027s d and odds ratios were used as a measure of effect size for RCTs. A random effects model was used to account for different sources of variation among studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics, I², Tau, and Tau². Publication bias was analysed and represented by a funnel plot, and funnel plot symmetry was assessed with Egger\u0027s test. The results showed that in the RCTs, the patients receiving a low-FODMAP diet experienced a statistically significant pain and bloating reduction compared with those receiving a traditional diet; as regards to stool consistency, there was no significant difference between treatments. A significant reduction in abdominal pain and bloating were described by patients receiving a low-FODMAP diet compared with those receiving a high-FODMAP diet. In cohort studies, pain and bloating were significantly reduced after treatment compared with the baseline diet. We conclude that there is evidence that a low-FODMAP diet could have a favourable impact on IBS symptoms, especially abdominal pain and bloating. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether a low-FODMAP diet is superior to conventional IBS diets, especially in the long term.",

        "Studies have shown that a low FODMAP diet is increasingly recommended for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as it has been found to be effective in managing symptoms. The FODMAP diet involves restricting Fermentable Oligosaccharide, Disaccharide, Monosaccharide, and Polyols in the diet, which can help alleviate symptoms of IBS. Additionally, general dietary advice should be offered to all IBS patients, and psyllium supplementation is recommended for those with both constipation and diarrhea predominance. While other diets, such as a low-carbohydrate diet, may also be adopted by individuals with IBS, the low FODMAP diet holds the greatest significance and is currently recommended by NICE as a short-term approach to nutrition. However, it\u0027s worth noting that the low FODMAP diet does not yield positive results for everyone affected, and clear nutritional recommendations have not been established thus far, highlighting the need for further research in this area.",
        "People with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are generally recommended to follow specific dietary changes to manage their symptoms. A high-fiber diet can help improve bowel movements and alleviate symptoms. However, individuals may also benefit from dietary restrictions, including reducing the intake of fermented carbohydrates, coffee, and alcohol. Elimination diets, which involve removing specific foods to identify triggers, are also useful.\n\nA low FODMAP diet, which reduces fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, is effective in controlling symptoms. Limiting lactose consumption can help those who are lactose intolerant, while controlling the intake of fructose and fructans found in certain fruits and vegetables can also be beneficial. Low-carbohydrate diets aim to reduce substrates available for fermentation in the gut, thereby managing IBS symptoms.\n\nSome patients find relief by avoiding gluten, even if they do not have celiac disease. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrients can reduce symptom severity, bloating, and abdominal pain, and improve the overall quality of life. Although individual responses to dietary changes can vary, a combination of these dietary strategies is generally recommended for managing IBS. Each patient may need to tailor their diet based on their specific triggers and nutritional needs to achieve the best symptom control."

Furthermore, macrophages can release a wide array of growth factors and cytokines in response to factors produced by tumor and non-tumor cells in the TME.\n\nOverall, macrophages exert immunosuppressive effects that impede glioblastoma treatment, making them a key target for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the TME.",
        "Macrophages play a crucial role in the glioblastoma microenvironment by promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. They can adopt different phenotypes, including M1 and M2, which have distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment. M1 macrophages can induce an inflammatory response and inhibit tumor growth, while M2 macrophages can promote tumor progression and metastasis. Additionally, macrophages can produce various factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, that shape the tumor microenvironment and influence the behavior of other immune cells. In glioblastoma, macrophages can also interact with cancer cells to influence mesenchymal-like programs and promote chemotherapeutic resistance. Overall, the role of macrophages in glioblastoma is complex and multifaceted, and understanding their mechanisms of action is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies.",
        "Macrophages significantly influence the glioblastoma microenvironment through various mechanisms. They create an immunosuppressive state that hinders immune responses against cancer cells and support tumor growth as part of the inflammatory infiltrate. Macrophages also facilitate tumor invasion and migration by modulating the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases. By disturbing hyaluronic acid synthesis or blocking CD44 binding, macrophages can be polarized to an M1 phenotype, which helps inhibit glioblastoma growth. Experimental studies show that certain treatments can increase the expression of proinflammatory markers in macrophages and glioblastoma cells. Additionally, macrophages can induce a mesenchymal-like transition in glioblastoma cells and adopt a mesenchymal program themselves, promoting T cell cytotoxicity. They also produce chemokines that recruit regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, fostering local immunosuppression and tumor progression.

About half of the patients lost the detectable EGFR T790M mutation upon progression, and a significant subset developed multiple resistance-related genomic changes, including MET amplification and EGFR C797 alterations. Two patterns of resistance were observed: one where T790M persisted but accompanied by additional mutations such as C797S, and another where T790M was lost and replaced by a variety of genomic alterations like acquired KRAS mutations and gene fusions—this group experienced a shorter time to treatment discontinuation. Additionally, monitoring using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was effective, with progression detected in more than half of the patients, often preceding radiological progression by about three months. ctDNA analysis also revealed alterations in the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway, suggesting that adding an AKT inhibitor to osimertinib might help counteract resistance.",
        "The AURA3 trial, which investigated osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), identified several mechanisms of acquired resistance to this third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Key findings from the trial include the emergence of various genetic alterations that confer resistance to osimertinib. These alterations include secondary mutations in the EGFR gene, such as C797S, which prevent osimertinib from effectively binding to the EGFR protein, thereby reducing its inhibitory effects (PMID 36849516). Additionally, the trial highlighted the development of bypass signaling pathways, which can activate downstream signaling independent of EGFR inhibition, thus diminishing the therapeutic impact of osimertinib (PMID 36849516). These findings underscore the complexity of acquired resistance in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC and highlight the need for ongoing research to develop strategies to overcome or prevent resistance to EGFR-TKIs like osimertinib.",

The main findings from this trial indicate that acquired resistance to osimertinib develops after approximately 1 year of treatment, with over 50% of cases due to the T790M secondary mutation of the EGFR gene. A retrospective analysis of the AURA3 trial, as well as another phase III trial called FLAURA, explored the mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib and found that T790M subclonality impacts response to osimertinib. Additionally, circulating tumor DNA progression preceded or coincided with radiographic progression, highlighting the potential of liquid biopsies to monitor disease progression. Overall, the AURA3 trial provides valuable insights into the efficacy and resistance mechanisms of osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, informing future treatment strategies for this patient population.",

Notably, 19% of patients develop multiple resistance-related genomic alterations.

        "The AURA3 trial investigated mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identified several key findings. Resistance mechanisms include EGFR mutations in 22% of patients, MET amplification and the EGFR C797X mutation in 18% of patients each. Approximately 50% of patients exhibited undetectable plasma EGFR T790M at disease progression, with reports indicating this range could be from 42% to 68% of patients. Progressive disease (PD) detected by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) often preceded or co-occurred with radiologically defined PD, with ctDNA PD being observed before or at the same time as RECIST-defined PD in 56% of patients. The mechanisms of acquired resistance were heterogeneous and showed no clear correlation with the duration of osimertinib treatment. Acquired resistance to osimertinib is considered inevitable, with several complex mutations identified during the trial. These findings highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of acquired resistance to osimertinib in NSCLC patients.",

        "Xylazine, a veterinary sedative, has increasingly become a significant concern in the context of illicit drug use. It is frequently found mixed with heroin, fentanyl, and other strong opioids, often to prolong the euphoric effects. The presence of xylazine as an adulterant in drugs is supported by numerous drug seizures and increasing overdoses linked to its use. \n\nShort-term use of xylazine can cause bradycardia, brief hypertension followed by hypotension, edema, and central nervous system depression. Chronic use can lead to severe skin abscesses, necrosis, respiratory issues, decreased heart rate, potential amputations, and severe withdrawal symptoms. Xylazine use results in naloxone-resistant overdoses and significant health deterioration among chronic users, with higher rates of fatal overdoses noted among users.\n\nPeople who inject drugs and use xylazine report higher rates of homelessness, polysubstance use, overdose history, and hepatitis C. Awareness about xylazine among drug users and harm reduction workers is notable, highlighting the rising concern and the need for better harm reduction strategies.

        "Yes, obesity can be considered a familial syndrome. Both genetic predisposition and family behaviors contribute to its occurrence. Studies indicate that obesity tends to run in families, suggesting inherited genetic factors influence body weight. Additionally, shared family dietary habits and lifestyle choices play significant roles in the development of obesity.",
        "Yes, obesity can exhibit familial patterns, often influenced by genetic predisposition. While most obesity cases are polygenic (involving multiple genes) and multifactorial (lifestyle, environment), specific monogenic forms (e.g., Gsα deficiency) and syndromes (e.g., Prader-Willi) demonstrate hereditary transmission. Familial clustering of obesity is well-documented, with studies showing genetic correlations and inherited risk factors (e.g., polygenic risk scores). However, it is not universally a familial syndrome, as environmental factors significantly contribute.",
        "Obesity can indeed be influenced by familial factors, as evidenced by both genetic and epigenetic components. The studies indicate that there is a heritable aspect to BMI, with genetics accounting for approximately 39% of the variability. Additionally, epigenetic variations associated with waist circumference suggest that family environment and genetics may contribute to obesity risk. However, it\u0027s crucial to acknowledge that environmental factors, such as diet and physical activity, also significantly influence the development of obesity. Therefore, while there is a familial component, obesity is not solely determined by genetic factors but is also shaped by lifestyle choices and shared family environments."

        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting bronchodilators used in the treatment of asthma. The primary difference in their action is that formoterol has a rapid onset of action, while salmeterol causes bronchodilation more slowly. This difference is attributed to their pharmacological properties, with formoterol being a full agonist with higher intrinsic activity and adequate water solubility, allowing for rapid diffusion to the beta2-receptor. In contrast, salmeterol is a partial agonist with high lipophilicity, leading to a slower diffusion to the beta2-receptor.",
        "Salmeterol and formoterol are both long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) used in the treatment of asthma. However, there are some differences in their action. Salmeterol has a longer duration of action compared to formoterol, but formoterol has a faster onset of action. Additionally, formoterol is more effective in improving asthma symptoms compared to salmeterol.",
        "The primary differences in action between formoterol and salmeterol are their onset of action and their agonist properties at the beta2-receptor. Formoterol acts rapidly, within minutes, as a full agonist, whereas salmeterol has a slower onset as a partial agonist. Despite these differences, both are classified as long-acting bronchodilators, used in managing conditions like asthma and COPD, with their distinct properties influencing their suitability for specific clinical applications.",
        "Fomoterol and salmeterol are both bronchodilators, but they may have different specific actions. Fomoterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist, while salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist. Therefore, the difference in action between fomoterol and salmeterol lies in their duration of action. Fomoterol has a shorter duration of action compared to salmeterol.",
        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) used for asthma and COPD, but they differ in several key ways. Formoterol has a more rapid onset of action, providing significant bronchodilation within 3 minutes, and is considered a full agonist on the beta2-receptor. It remains effective for about 12 hours. Salmeterol, in contrast, has a slower onset due to its partial agonist nature and high lipophilicity, but it maintains bronchodilation for many hours after administration. Formoterol is more potent and induces greater tissue relaxation compared to salmeterol, which has a lesser relaxant effect. Additionally, formoterol requires higher concentrations for sustained effects but shows reversible relaxation with higher doses, whereas salmeterol can sustain effects even at lower concentrations and exhibits irreversible relaxation at higher doses. Both drugs are associated with an increased risk of serious asthma-related events when used as monotherapy. However, when used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), they do not significantly increase the risk of severe asthma-related events compared to ICS alone. Overall, formoterol acts more quickly and is more potent initially, while salmeterol offers longer-lasting bronchodilatory effects.",

Onset of Action:\n   - Formoterol has a rapid onset of action, typically within a few minutes, making it suitable for both maintenance therapy and as a reliever in acute situations.\n   - Salmeterol has a slower onset of action, usually taking about 30 minutes to start working, making it unsuitable for relief of acute symptoms and more appropriate for maintenance therapy.\n\n2. Duration of Action:\n   - Both drugs have a long duration of action, lasting approximately 12 hours, allowing for twice-daily dosing.\n\n3. Binding Characteristics:\n   - Formoterol binds to the beta-2 adrenergic receptors quickly and with high intrinsic activity, leading to its rapid onset.\n   - Salmeterol binds to the beta-2 adrenergic receptors more slowly and has a prolonged binding due to its unique molecular structure, contributing to its slower onset but sustained action.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference lies in the onset of action, with formoterol acting quickly and salmeterol acting more slowly, though both provide long-lasting bronchodilation.",
        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting beta2-agonists, but they differ in their onset of action. Formoterol has a faster onset of action compared to salmeterol.

It also exhibits a\u0027reassertion\u0027 behavior, where the effects are reasserted at a rate inversely related to the lipophilicity of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.\n\nSalmeterol, on the other hand, is a partial agonist at beta2-adrenoceptors and has a longer duration of action, typically lasting around 12 hours, but with a more persistent effect. Salmeterol also exhibits a\u0027reassertion\u0027 behavior, but with a slower recovery rate compared to formoterol.

        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long‑acting β2‑adrenergic agonists with about 12‑hour duration of action, but they differ in how they activate the receptor and in their clinical use. Formoterol is a full agonist that binds directly at the β2‑receptor’s active site, producing rapid bronchodilation within minutes and making it suitable for both maintenance therapy and relief of acute bronchospasm. Salmeterol is a partial agonist whose long lipophilic tail anchors in an adjacent receptor groove, resulting in a slower onset of around 15–20 minutes and use solely for maintenance rather than as a rescue inhaler.",
        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but they differ in their onset of action. Formoterol has a rapid onset of action, similar to short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) like albuterol, making it suitable for both maintenance and quick relief of bronchospasm. Salmeterol, on the other hand, has a slower onset of action and is therefore primarily used for maintenance therapy to prevent bronchospasm, not for immediate relief. This difference in onset is attributed to their varying lipophilicity and receptor binding kinetics. Formoterol achieves a quicker effect due to its faster access to beta2-adrenergic receptors, while salmeterol\u0027s slower onset is due to its greater lipophilicity, which causes it to reside longer in the cell membrane before binding to the receptor.",

This means that formoterol can maintain its bronchodilatory effect even in the presence of low β2-adrenoceptor availability, such as in inflamed airways. Additionally, formoterol has a faster onset of action compared to salmeterol, which may be beneficial for patients who require quick relief of symptoms. The pharmacological properties of formoterol, including its lipophilicity, contribute to its rapid diffusion to the β2-receptor on smooth muscle, resulting in its rapid bronchodilating activity.

        "Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) used to manage asthma and COPD, but they differ in several pharmacological properties.\n\nFormoterol has a rapid onset of action due to its water solubility and moderate lipophilicity, allowing it to start working within minutes. It has a duration of effect of approximately 12 hours, suitable for twice-daily dosing. Formoterol is more potent than salmeterol, acting as a full agonist at the β2-adrenoceptors, achieving a maximal response once bound.\n\nIn contrast, salmeterol has a slower onset of action due to its higher lipophilicity, leading to delayed drug delivery to the β2 receptors in the lung. Like formoterol, salmeterol also has a long duration of action of at least 12 hours, making it suitable for twice-daily administration. However, salmeterol functions as a partial agonist, achieving less than the maximal possible response even when fully bound to the receptor, resulting in a lower peak effect compared to formoterol.\n\nClinically, formoterol-containing combinations can provide more rapid bronchodilatory effects than salmeterol combinations.

        "Based on the provided abstracts, there are several potential biomarkers for borderline personality disorder (BPD) that have been identified. These include:\n\n1. P300 component: This is an event-related potential that has been found to have a moderate, positive relationship with BPD symptoms.\n2. Cortisol levels: Studies have shown that basal cortisol levels in individuals with BPD are significantly lower than in non-psychiatric controls.\n3. Functional connectivity patterns: Machine-learning approaches using whole-brain functional connectivity have shown moderate accuracy in differentiating BPD patients from healthy controls.\n4. MGLL intronic C\u003eT single nucleotide polymorphism (rs782440): This SNP has been associated with an increased risk of BPD.\n5. APBA3 and MCF2 DNA methylation: These genes have been found to be epigenetically dysregulated in BPD, and their methylation status may serve as a potential biomarker for treatment outcome.\n6. Altered brain activity: Studies have shown alterations in brain activity, particularly in the limbic-cortical circuit and default mode network regions, which may serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for BPD.\n7. IRS-1 Gly972Arg and CYP11B2 -344T/C genotypes: These genotypes have been associated with a predisposition for BPD with comorbid major depressive disorder.\n8. Elevated serum IL-6 levels: This inflammatory marker has been found to be significantly higher in patients with BPD and major depressive disorder.\n9. miR-124-3p target genes: The expression of these genes in the globus pallidus may be associated with recovery from suicidal ideation in BPD.\n10. Inflammatory and oxidative endophenotypes: Cluster analysis has identified subgroups of BPD patients with similar inflammatory/oxidative biomarker alterations, which may be associated with different clinical features.\n\nIt is important to note that while these biomarkers show promise, further research and replication are needed to establish their clinical utility in diagnosing or treating BPD.",
        "There is currently no single validated biomarker for borderline personality disorder. Various promising candidates have been identified, including regional cortical thinning and modest reductions in hippocampal and amygdala volumes on MRI; abnormal resting‑state functional and structural connectivity involving the anterior cingulate, middle frontal and temporal gyri; EEG measures such as altered sleep patterns, P300 potentials and right‑hemisphere frontal asymmetry; dysregulation of the HPA axis with altered cortisol levels; oxytocin system dysfunction; changes in peripheral inflammatory and oxidative markers (elevated JNK and ERK, reduced GPx, SOD and Keap1); and differential DNA methylation at sites near miR‑124‑3. None of these is yet an objective diagnostic test.",
        "Yes, several potential biomarkers for borderline personality disorder (BPD) have been identified in research, though further validation is needed. These include:  \n1. **Neurophysiological markers**: Altered P300 event-related potentials (EEG), linked to trauma-associated disorders and BPD.  \n2. **Epigenetic markers**: Methylation differences in the *OPRK1* gene promoter and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with childhood trauma and BPD risk.  \n3. **Neuroimaging markers**: Reduced globus pallidus (GP) volume (regulated by miR-124-3p), altered activity in limbic-cortical circuits, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during response inhibition.  \n4. **Oxidative stress markers**: Elevated 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-DG) levels, correlating with BPD symptom severity.  \n5. **Cellular markers**: Altered protein expression in neural progenitor cells (nhNPCs-OE) from BPD patients.  \n\nThese findings highlight emerging candidates but require replication and clinical validation for diagnostic or prognostic use.",
        "**Answer:**\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition characterized by emotional instability and interpersonal difficulties. Research has identified several potential biomarkers for BPD, though they remain in the exploratory phase and not yet standardized for clinical use.\n\n1. **Electrophysiological Markers**: Studies have highlighted P300 components in event-related potentials measured via EEG as a possible biomarker, particularly relevant to trauma-associated disorders like BPD.\n\n2. **Genetic and Epigenetic Factors**: Methylation differences in the OPRK1 gene promoter and DMRs (differentially methylated regions) are being investigated as biomarkers linked to childhood trauma contributing to BPD development.\n\n3. **Protein Alterations**: Research indicates altered protein markers in nhNPCs-OE cells specific to MDD and BPD, suggesting potential biological changes associated with these disorders.\n\n4. **Neural Activity Changes**: Studies have found alterations in brain activity using ALFF (Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations) in limbic-cortical circuits and DMN regions in adolescents with BPD, pointing towards possible neural biomarkers.\n\n5. **Structural Brain Markers**: A reduction in GP (globus pallidus) volume through miR-124-3p regulation has been suggested as a biomarker for recovery from suicidal ideation in BPD patients.\n\n6. **Oxidative Stress Indicators**: Elevated 8-OH-DG levels have been correlated with the number of BPD symptoms, indicating oxidative stress markers might be relevant.\n\nWhile these findings offer promising directions, further research is necessary to validate and standardize these biomarkers for clinical application in diagnosing or managing BPD."

Specifically, a study has investigated the association of low blood pressure, low BMI, and low non-HDL cholesterol with the risk of late-life dementia (PMID 35918162). The findings suggest a potential inverse relationship, where lower values rather than higher values of these measures could be of concern in the context of dementia risk. This challenges the common perception that higher levels of these parameters universally contribute to increased health risks, including dementia. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both extremes of these measurements in the assessment and management of dementia risk.

Dementia risk was substantially higher in individuals with low values for all three risk factors than expected based on a dose-response relationship, suggesting an overarching phenomenon involving multiple risk factors simultaneously.

This subset is distinguished from other memory subsets like effector memory (TEM), which lacks CCR7, and naïve cells, which lack CD45RO.

This combination distinguishes them from other memory T cell subsets, such as effector memory T cells, which typically do not express CCR7.",
        "The T cell memory subset characterized by high CD45RO and CCR7 expression is typically associated with central memory T cells (T_CM). These cells are distinguished by their expression of CD45RO, which is a marker of memory status, and CCR7, a chemokine receptor that facilitates lymph node homing and maintenance within lymphoid organs. Central memory T cells are crucial for long-term immunological memory as they possess the capacity to proliferate extensively and differentiate into effector T cells upon antigen re-exposure, thus providing a rapid and robust response to previously encountered pathogens (PMID 21926977).\n\nThe importance of different T cell subsets, including memory and effector T cells, is further emphasized in their roles in adoptive cell transfer therapies, such as CAR-T cell therapy, where understanding the functional capacities and differentiation potential of these cells can significantly impact therapeutic outcomes (PMID 26999211). This highlights the critical role of T_CM cells not only in natural immune defense mechanisms but also in engineered approaches to immunotherapy.",

This subset is known for its role in long-term immune memory, circulating between secondary lymphoid organs, which is consistent with the expression of CCR7.

It is a genetically engineered variant of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is a naturally occurring enzyme in the body that helps dissolve blood clots. Tenecteplase has been modified to have a longer half-life than native tPA, allowing for rapid administration in a single intravenous bolus dose. This modification enhances its binding affinity for fibrin, which is a key component of blood clots. The use of tenecteplase in clinical settings aims to rapidly dissolve clots that are obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle, thereby restoring perfusion and minimizing heart tissue damage. Its efficacy and safety profile make it a valuable therapeutic option in the management of myocardial infarction, with the goal of improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality associated with this condition.",

        "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 (LOH#10) is the most frequent genetic alteration in glioblastomas, in which several tumor suppressor genes, other than PTEN, have been identified. The majority (88%) of primary glioblastomas with LOH#10 show LOH at all informative markers, suggesting loss of the entire chromosome 10. In contrast, secondary glioblastomas with LOH#10 showed partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q but no loss of 10p. These results are in accordance with the view that LOH on 10q is a major factor in the evolution of glioblastoma multiform as the common phenotypic endpoint of both genetic pathways, whereas LOH on 10p is largely restricted to the primary glioblastoma.",
        "Studies carried out on glioblastomas have shown that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 is a frequent genetic alteration in these tumors. Specifically, secondary glioblastomas with loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 tend to show partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q, but not loss of 10p. This suggests that loss of chromosomal region 10q is a common feature of secondary glioblastomas, and may play a role in their development. In contrast, primary glioblastomas often exhibit loss of the entire chromosome 10, including both 10q and 10p regions. These findings indicate that different genetic pathways may be involved in the development of primary and secondary glioblastomas, and highlight the importance of chromosomal region 10q in the evolution of secondary glioblastomas.",
        "Secondary glioblastomas frequently exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10q, showing partial or complete loss of the 10q region while maintaining chromosome 10p, which distinguishes them from primary glioblastomas that typically lose the entire chromosome 10. This LOH on chromosome 10q is considered a major factor in glioblastoma evolution and involves potential tumor suppressor genes, including but not limited to PTEN.",
        "In secondary glioblastomas, the most common chromosomal region lost is the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q), while primary glioblastomas with LOH#10 often show loss of the entire chromosome 10. The involvement of 10q is a major factor in the evolution of glioblastoma, while 10p losses are largely restricted to primary glioblastomas.",
        "In secondary glioblastoma, a frequently lost chromosomal region is chromosome 10q. This specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10q is a significant factor in the progression of secondary glioblastoma. Unlike primary glioblastoma, which often involves loss of the entire chromosome 10 or specifically the 10p region, secondary glioblastoma predominantly exhibits partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q. This distinction underscores the different genetic pathways that lead to primary versus secondary glioblastoma, with LOH on 10q playing a crucial role in the latter (PMID 10653004).",
        "The most frequently lost chromosomal region in secondary glioblastoma is chromosome 10q, often involving partial or complete loss of this region, while chromosome 10p is typically retained. This contrasts with primary glioblastomas, which commonly show loss of the entire chromosome 10 (both 10p and 10q).",
        "The frequently lost chromosomal region in secondary glioblastoma is **chromosome 10q**. This loss occurs specifically in the long arm of chromosome 10 and is a significant factor in the evolution of secondary glioblastomas, distinguishing them from primary glioblastomas where both arms (10p and 10q) may be affected.",
        "In secondary glioblastomas, the frequently lost chromosomal region is primarily 10q. While these tumors exhibit partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q, they do not show loss of 10p, unlike primary glioblastomas which often lose the entire chromosome 10. This pattern supports the notion that LOH on 10q plays a significant role in the development of glioblastoma multiforme through both genetic pathways.",
        "In secondary glioblastomas, the frequently lost chromosomal region is the long arm of chromosome 10, specifically chromosome 10q. This is in contrast to primary glioblastomas, where the entire chromosome 10 is often lost due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The loss of chromosome 10q in secondary glioblastomas is a significant factor in their evolution, as it is a major contributor to the development of glioblastoma multiform, the common phenotypic end point of both genetic pathways."

In this Review, we discuss the current literature, which shows that despite what might be inferred during training, physicians are not immune to mental illness, with between a quarter and a third reporting increased symptoms of mental ill health. Physicians, particularly female physicians, are at an increased risk of suicide. An emerging consensus exists that some aspects of physician training, working conditions, and organisational support are unacceptable. Changes in medical training and health systems, and the additional strain of working through a pandemic, might have amplified these problems. A new evidence-informed framework for how individual and organisational interventions can be used in an integrated manner in medical schools, in health-care settings, and by professional colleagues is proposed. New initiatives are required at each of these levels, with an urgent need for organisational-level interventions, to better protect the mental health and wellbeing of physicians.",

Furthermore, at least in Sweden, general surgeons, not psychiatrists, have the highest suicide rate of all physicians.",
        "Based on the analysis of available data and studies, it is evident that physicians experience a higher risk of suicide compared to the general population. Several factors contribute to this elevated risk:\n\n1. **High-Stress Environment**: Physicians work in demanding settings characterized by life-and-death decisions, long hours, and challenging patient interactions, which can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression.\n\n2. **Gender Differences**: Female physicians are particularly affected, with studies indicating significantly higher suicide rates compared to the general population. Male physicians also face elevated risks but not as pronounced as their female counterparts.\n\n3. **Specialty Variations**: Certain medical specialties, such as general surgery, report higher suicide rates among physicians. In Sweden, for instance, general surgeons have the highest rate of suicide among all physician groups.\n\n4. **Access to Mental Health Resources**: Despite their professional background in healthcare, physicians may face barriers to accessing mental health support due to stigma or other factors within the medical community.\n\nIn conclusion, while physicians as a whole are at higher risk of suicide than the general population, this risk is not uniform across all genders and specialties. Female physicians and certain surgical specialists appear to be particularly vulnerable. Addressing these disparities through targeted mental health support and reducing professional stress could help mitigate this risk.",
        "Yes, physicians are at a higher risk of suicide compared to the general population. Studies indicate that both male and female physicians experience elevated rates of mental health issues such as burnout, anxiety, and depression, which are significant risk factors for suicide. Female physicians, in particular, have been shown to be more prone to suicide than most other women, while male physicians also face higher risks compared to other male academics.\n\nAdditionally, certain specialties within medicine exhibit higher suicide rates. For instance, general surgeons in Sweden have the highest suicide rate among physicians. This highlights that the risk is not uniform across all physician groups but varies by specialty and gender.\n\nThe reasons behind these statistics are multifaceted, including high-stress work environments, long hours, exposure to life-and-death situations, and potential stigma around seeking mental health help within the medical profession. Access to means, such as medications, may also contribute to this risk.\n\nIn conclusion, physicians, especially female physicians and those in certain surgical specialties, face a disproportionately higher risk of suicide compared to the general population. Addressing these issues requires targeted interventions to support mental health and reduce stigma within the medical community."

        "The limited therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy against glioblastoma is closely related to the blood-brain barrier and tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, where the latter is driven primarily by tumor-associated myeloid cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a subset of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived cells, are known to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment of GBM, where the CCL2-CCR2 axis has been shown to be important for this process and thus, presents as a promising approach for alleviating immunosuppression.",
        "CCL2 (Chemokine Ligand 2) is involved in recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). This is supported by multiple studies, which show that CCL2 promotes the recruitment of MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages to the GBM microenvironment, leading to immunosuppression and T cell exhaustion. The CCL2-CCR2 axis has been identified as a key mechanism underlying this process.",
        "CCL2, acting through its receptor CCR2, is the chemokine specifically involved in recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumor microenvironment of Glioblastoma (GBM), distinct from the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway which primarily recruits tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs). The CCL2-CCR2 axis plays a crucial role in GBM\u0027s immunosuppressive environment, offering a potential therapeutic target for enhancing treatment efficacy.",

This CCL2-CCR2 axis plays a significant role in the recruitment of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of GBM.",
        "The chemokine involved in recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is **CCL2**. This chemokine interacts with its receptor, CCR2, facilitating the migration of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment where they contribute to immunosuppression.",

This axis plays a significant role in the infiltration of MDSCs into the tumor microenvironment of GBM. The CCL2-CCR2 axis is a chemokine and its receptor, respectively, which work together to facilitate cell migration and recruitment.

        "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease, with limited treatment options. Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed relative homogeneity of the major transcriptional subtypes (luminal, basal, and mesenchymal) within samples. Interestingly, the mesenchymal TNBCs share features with mesenchymal neuroblastoma, with the PRRX1 transcription factor being a key driver of these tumors. In TNBC, PRRX1 is sufficient for inducing mesenchymal features in basal but not in luminal cells via reprogramming super-enhancer landscapes, but it is not required for mesenchymal state maintenance or cellular viability. Similarly, in neuroblastoma, expression of the PRRX1 could reprogram the super-enhancer and mRNA landscapes of adrenergic cells toward a mesenchymal state.",
        "Yes, neuroblastoma does share mesenchymal-like transcriptional programs with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Research utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing has demonstrated that mesenchymal TNBCs exhibit transcriptional similarities with mesenchymal neuroblastoma, as well as with rhabdoid tumors. This similarity is driven by the transcription factor PRRX1, which plays a crucial role in inducing mesenchymal features in these tumors. Specifically, PRRX1 is capable of reprogramming super-enhancer landscapes to induce mesenchymal features in basal TNBC cells, although it is not necessary for the maintenance of the mesenchymal state or for cellular viability (PMID 38100350). Additionally, the expression of PRRX1 has been shown to reprogram the super-enhancer and mRNA landscapes of adrenergic cells toward a mesenchymal state, further supporting its role in mesenchymal transcriptional programming across different cancer types (PMID 28650485).",
        "Studies demonstrate that neuroblastoma and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) share mesenchymal-like transcriptional programs. Both cancers exhibit heterogeneity, with TNBC having luminal, basal, and mesenchymal subtypes, while neuroblastoma includes undifferentiated mesenchymal and committed adrenergic cells. The transcription factor PRRX1 plays a crucial role in both, driving the mesenchymal state by reprogramming super-enhancer landscapes. In TNBC, PRRX1 induces mesenchymal features in basal cells, whereas in neuroblastoma, it converts adrenergic cells to a mesenchymal phenotype. Both cancers show that mesenchymal-like cells are more chemoresistant and prevalent in relapse tumors, highlighting a common mechanism involving PRRX1-mediated epigenetic regulation. This shared biology underscores potential therapeutic targets for these aggressive cancer types."

We first cover the conceptual issues of prevalence, diagnostic practices, diversity, comorbidity, and causal factors, plus forces limiting awareness of ADHD in females. After a narrative review of cross-sectional and longitudinal findings, we conclude the following. (a) Girls meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD at just under half the rates of boys, a ratio that becomes much closer to equal by adulthood. (b) Girls and women with ADHD show a predominance of inattention and associated internalizing problems; boys and men display greater levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and associated externalizing problems. (c) Sex differences in ADHD symptoms and related outcomes depend heavily on the clinical versus nonreferred nature of the samples under investigation. (d) Females with ADHD experience, on average, serious impairments, with a particularly heightened risk for problems in close relationships and engagement in self-harm. (e) Clinicians may overlook symptoms and impairments in females because of less overt (but still impairing) symptom manifestations in girls and women and their frequent adoption of compensatory strategies. Our review of predictors and mediators of adult outcomes highlights (a) the potential for heterotypically continuous pathways in females with childhood ADHD and (b) developmental progressions to self-harm, intimate partner violence, unplanned pregnancy, and comorbid psychopathology. Focusing on ADHD in females is necessary to characterize causal and maintaining mechanisms with accuracy and to foster responsive interventions, as highlighted in our closing list of clinical implications and research priorities.",

However, when girls are diagnosed with ADHD, they are more often diagnosed as predominantly inattentive than boys with ADHD. This article provides a review of gender differences noted across the lifespan. Males and females with ADHD are more similar than different, and generally ADHD profiles are not sex specific. Small gender differences have been found: adolescent girls with ADHD have lower self-efficacy and poorer coping strategies than adolescent boys with ADHD; rates of depression and anxiety may be higher, and physical aggression and other externalizing behaviors lower in girls and women with ADHD. Men with ADHD seem to be incarcerated more often than women with ADHD. However, many studies suffer from small sample sizes, referral biases, differences in diagnostic procedures, and possible rater influences. Treatments are reviewed and discussed with reference to the reported gender differences in functioning and the global deficits noted in all samples. The data available so far suggest that treatments are likely to be equally effective in males and females. However, referral bias is a problem, in that females with ADHD are less likely to be referred for treatment than males with ADHD. Future research should include equal representation of both sexes in samples such that sex by treatment analyses can be routinely conducted.",

        "Girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often present with predominantly inattentive symptoms, which are less overt than the hyperactive and impulsive behaviors more commonly seen in boys. This can lead to underdiagnosis, as their symptoms may be perceived as less disruptive or even \"subthreshold.\" Girls with ADHD are also at higher risk for comorbid internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, girls with ADHD experience significant peer functioning difficulties, including lower friendship stability, higher rates of peer rejection, and increased peer victimization. These challenges are often linked to social skills deficits and conduct problems. Furthermore, hormonal fluctuations across the lifespan may influence symptom presentation, making it crucial for healthcare providers to recognize these gender-specific characteristics to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate intervention.",
        "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can present differently in girls compared to boys, with girls more likely to exhibit inattentive symptoms rather than hyperactive or impulsive behaviors. These symptoms can include difficulty paying attention to details, making careless mistakes, trouble sustaining attention, not seeming to listen when spoken to directly, not following through on instructions, difficulty organizing tasks, avoiding tasks that require sustained mental effort, losing things necessary for tasks, being easily distracted, and forgetfulness in daily activities. Girls with ADHD may also experience more internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression, and they might face more social and academic challenges. Because their symptoms can be less overt than those seen in boys, ADHD in girls is often underdiagnosed or diagnosed later in life."

Environmental factors, such as long-term air pollution exposure, may contribute to the development of these conditions in older adults, particularly for those with higher genetic predispositions. Thus, it is established that schizophrenia can present itself beyond the typical age range, highlighting the importance of recognizing and diagnosing these cases in later life.",
        "Yes, schizophrenia can indeed be diagnosed after the age of 50. This is recognized in the medical community as \"late-onset schizophrenia,\" which typically occurs between ages 40 and 60. Additionally, there is a category called \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis\" that applies to individuals over 60. These conditions highlight that while early onset is more common, schizophrenia can manifest later in life due to various factors, including genetic risks and environmental influences like long-term air pollution exposure. Thus, it is possible for someone to receive a schizophrenia diagnosis after turning 50."

The treatment options after diagnosis and surgical resection (if possible) include irradiation, temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, and now tumor treating fields (TTFields). TTFields are electric fields delivered locoregionally to the head/tumor via a wearable medical device (Optune®). Overall, the concomitant treatment of TTFields and TMZ target tumor cells but spare normal cell types in the brain. Here, we examine whether primary cilia, microtubule-based \"antennas\" found on both normal brain cells and GBM cells, play specific roles in sensitizing tumor cells to treatment. We discuss evidence supporting GBM cilia being exploited by tumor cells to promote their growth and treatment resistance. We review how primary cilia on normal brain and GBM cells are affected by GBM treatments as monotherapy or concomitant modalities. We also focus on latest findings indicating a differential regulation of GBM ciliogenesis by TTFields and TMZ.

Acute infectious gastroenteritis can trigger IBS symptoms in some individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and involve alterations in the gut microbiome, immune system, and intestinal function.

        "Infiltrating macrophages in glioblastoma (GBM) primarily originate from peripheral blood monocytes. While resident microglia are present in the brain, the majority of infiltrating macrophages in GBM tumors are derived from bone marrow-derived myeloid cells that enter the central nervous system under pathological conditions such as tumor formation. Some studies indicate that bone marrow-derived macrophages are more abundant in the tumor bulk, while microglia-derived TAMs dominate the tumor periphery.",
        "Infiltrating macrophages in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) primarily derive from circulating monocytes originating in the bone marrow. While the brain contains resident microglia, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier in GBM allows peripheral bone marrow-derived monocytes to infiltrate the central nervous system. These monocytes differentiate into macrophages within the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) population. In older patients, a greater proportion of these macrophages are derived from extracranial monocyte-derived macrophages.",

        "The CAPIRI regimen is a chemotherapy treatment protocol used primarily for metastatic colorectal cancer. This regimen includes the medications capecitabine and irinotecan. Capecitabine is an orally administered prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is metabolized in the body to produce an anti-cancer effect by inhibiting DNA synthesis in cancer cells. Irinotecan, on the other hand, works as a topoisomerase inhibitor, preventing DNA from unwinding, which is essential for replication and transcription in cancer cells (PMID 25534239).\n\nThe combination of these two drugs leverages their distinct mechanisms of action to enhance the overall therapeutic efficacy against colorectal cancer. The regimen is often compared to other standard treatments such as FOLFIRI, which includes folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan, to evaluate its safety and effectiveness (PMID 22240792). Additionally, CAPIRI can be administered with bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, to further improve outcomes in certain clinical settings (PMID 19152449). This combination has been studied to ascertain its potential benefits in increasing progression-free survival and overall response rate in patients.",

This regimen is often compared to other treatments, such as FOLFIRI, which includes fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, in studies examining the efficacy and safety of various chemotherapy combinations for patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. In some studies, CAPIRI is also used in conjunction with bevacizumab, referred to as CAPIRI-BEV or BEV-CAPIRI, to assess its impact on treatment outcomes. Additionally, capecitabine and irinotecan are sometimes paired with other medications, like oxaliplatin, to form alternative regimens such as CAPOX. Overall, the CAPIRI regimen is an important component of various chemotherapy combinations used to treat colorectal cancer, with its efficacy and safety profile being evaluated in numerous studies.",

Capecitabine is an oral drug converted into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the body, which inhibits cancer cell growth by interfering with DNA synthesis. Irinotecan is administered intravenously and inhibits topoisomerase I, causing DNA damage and cell death. \n\nThe regimen usually follows a specific dosing schedule, such as administering irinotecan 200 mg/m² on day 1 and capecitabine 800 mg/m² twice daily from days 1 to 14, repeated every 3 weeks.\n\nThe CAPIRI regimen can also be combined with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), impeding blood vessel growth to the tumor. This combination enhances therapeutic efficacy but may result in higher occurrences of side effects like diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and hand-foot skin reactions.",

Capecitabine is typically administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, while irinotecan is given at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on specific days of treatment cycles. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A antibody, is also included in this regimen, usually at a dose of 5 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg on day 1 of treatment cycles. Modified versions of CAPIRI, such as mCAPIRI-P, which adds panitumumab to capecitabine and irinotecan, have also been explored in studies, demonstrating promising efficacy and acceptable safety profiles for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",

        "Studies have investigated whether breastfeeding poses a risk for mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Results show that breastfeeding does not increase this risk, even in mothers with high infectivity. In fact, human breastmilk contains active components, such as lactoferrin, which can bind to HBV and inhibit its infectivity. With proper immunoprophylaxis, including vaccination and hepatitis B immune globulin, breastfeeding is safe for infants of HBV-infected mothers. Studies have found no significant difference in HBV infection rates between breastfed and formula-fed infants, and many experts now recommend that HBV-infected mothers be encouraged to breastfeed their babies. Additionally, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a common treatment for HBV, has been shown to have negligible levels in breastmilk, further supporting breastfeeding as a safe option for these mothers. Overall, current evidence suggests that mothers positive for Hepatitis B can safely breastfeed their infants."

        "Tumors can evade immune responses through several mechanisms. They can express proteins like PD-L1 that bind to PD-1 receptors on T cells, inhibiting their activity and preventing them from attacking tumor cells. Tumors can also create an immunosuppressive microenvironment by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that inhibit effector T cells. Additionally, tumor cells can lose or alter the expression of antigens recognized by the immune system, making it harder for immune cells to identify and target them. Tumors can secrete immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-β, IL-10, and VEGF that suppress immune responses and promote tumor growth. They can also downregulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are necessary for presenting tumor antigens to T cells, thereby avoiding detection. Furthermore, tumors can induce a state of anergy (non-responsiveness) or exhaustion in T cells, reducing their ability to proliferate and attack tumor cells. These mechanisms allow tumors to grow and spread despite the presence of an immune system capable of recognizing and destroying abnormal cells.",

        "Tumors evade immune responses by using several strategies that allow them to avoid detection and destruction by the immune system. They often develop mutations that create variants less recognizable by immune cells. Additionally, tumors interfere with antigen presentation, altering the expression of key molecules on both cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells, which reduces T cell activation. They also modify their microenvironment by secreting factors that suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses. Some tumor cells, especially those with stem cell-like properties, exhibit low immunogenicity and release regulatory molecules that further dampen immune activity. Furthermore, tumors can impair the function of dendritic cells, hindering these cells’ ability to capture and present tumor antigens to T cells.

        "Tumors evade immune responses through several sophisticated mechanisms. Firstly, they employ camouflage strategies to hide from immune recognition, such as altering antigen presentation or downregulating surface molecules that are recognized by immune cells. Secondly, they use coercion tactics to interfere with immune effector cells, either directly by inhibiting their function or indirectly by altering the tumor microenvironment to suppress immune activity. This can involve the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines or the recruitment of regulatory cells that dampen immune responses. Thirdly, tumors utilize cytoprotection to shield themselves from immune cytotoxicity, which includes mechanisms like upregulating anti-apoptotic pathways or expressing immune checkpoint molecules that inhibit T cell activity. Additionally, tumors can accumulate specific metabolites and signaling factors within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that further inhibit immune responses or limit the availability of nutrients necessary for immune cell function, contributing to T cell exhaustion and reduced immune surveillance.",

The community physician needs to recognize the possibility of RLS to refer to a sleep specialist for diagnostic confirmation and management recommendations, which include oral iron therapy, even though there is currently no definitive research evidence for iron efficacy in most children with RLS. A 3 mg to 6 mg elemental iron/kg/day dose for three months could be tried if the ferritin level is \u003c50 ug/L. Sleep hygiene and behavioural strategies are also recommended.

It is characterized by an urge to move the legs, which is often accompanied by periodic limb movements during sleep. RLS has a high prevalence in the population and is usually a life-long condition. While its origins remain unclear, RLS is initially highly responsive to treatment with dopaminergic agonists that target D2-like receptors, in particular D2 and D3, but the long-term response is often unsatisfactory. Over the years, several putative animal models for RLS have been developed, mainly based on the epidemiological and neurochemical link with iron deficiency, treatment efficacy of D2-like dopaminergic agonists, or genome-wide association studies that identified risk factors in the patient population. Here, we present the first systematic review of putative animal models of RLS, provide information about their face and construct validity, and report their role in deciphering the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that may cause or contribute to RLS. We propose that identifying the causal links between genetic risk factors, altered organ functions, and changes to molecular pathways in neural circuitry will eventually lead to more effective new treatment options that bypass the side effects of the currently used therapeutics in RLS, especially for long-term therapy.",

RLS is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the extremities, generally at night or during sleep, which often leads to an uncontrollable urge to move them for relief. Recently, genomic studies identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in BTBD9, along with three other genes, as being associated with a higher risk of RLS. Little is known about the function of BTBD9 or its potential role in the pathophysiology of RLS. We therefore examined a line of Btbd9 mutant mice we recently generated for phenotypes similar to symptoms found in RLS patients. We observed that the Btbd9 mutant mice had motor restlessness, sensory alterations likely limited to the rest phase, and decreased sleep and increased wake times during the rest phase. Additionally, the Btbd9 mutant mice had altered serum iron levels and monoamine neurotransmitter systems. Furthermore, the sensory alterations in the Btbd9 mutant mice were relieved using ropinirole, a dopaminergic agonist widely used for RLS treatment. These results, taken together, suggest that the Btbd9 mutant mice model several characteristics similar to RLS and would therefore be the first genotypic mouse model of RLS. Furthermore, our data provide further evidence that BTBD9 is involved in RLS, and future studies of the Btbd9 mutant mice will help shine light on its role in the pathophysiology of RLS. Finally, our data argue for the utility of Btbd9 mutant mice to discover and screen novel therapeutics for RLS.",

        "The treatment for Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is multifaceted. Dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) are standard, improving sleep efficiency but with variable REM sleep effects. Stellate ganglion block is effective for patients with severe comorbidities. Botulinum toxin is considered for medically refractory cases, especially in young patients or those with a positive family history. Additionally, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose reduces RLS severity with minimal adverse effects, particularly beneficial for patients with iron deficiency anemia. A tailored approach based on patient-specific factors is recommended for optimal outcomes.",
        "Restless legs syndrome treatment depends on symptom severity. Mild cases are managed with lifestyle measures—avoiding caffeine, alcohol and nicotine; engaging in mental alerting activities; leg stretching; and iron supplementation if ferritin is low. Moderate to severe cases usually require drug therapy. First-line agents include non-ergot dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or rotigotine) or α2δ calcium-channel ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin). Dopaminergics should be used at the lowest effective dose to minimize augmentation risk, and α2δ ligands may be preferred as initial therapy. In cases of augmentation or refractory symptoms, switching between drug classes, using longer-acting dopaminergic agents, adding opioids (e.g., oxycodone-naloxone) or employing botulinum toxin injections can be effective. For rapid correction of iron deficiency, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose is an option. Severe, medically refractory cases have also been treated with interventions such as stellate ganglion block."
