At the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD), florbetapir's developer first reported data, later published in the JAMA, showing nearly perfect correlation between brain amyloid levels detected by florbetapir PET scans in study volunteers and levels found in autopsies of the same individuals a few months later. The developer has sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market florbetapir under the brand name Amyvid. The FDA has said it will withhold approval until the developer establishes a professional training program to ensure accuracy and consistency in reading and interpreting Amyvid scans.\n\nFlorbetaben (BAY 94-9172) is another radiotracer designed to detect beta-amyloid during a PET scan. Phase II study results and other florbetaben data were reported at the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD).
